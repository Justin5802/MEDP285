        <h2>What is Blue?</h2>
        <p>The color blue usually symbolizes confidence and authority that can be interpreted as peaceful yet dependable. While other colors like red may have darker or more sinister implications, blue can be viewed as a more positive color. Furthermore, it can also be considered a color of creativity, as indicated by some professional psychologists.</p>

        <h3>The Psychology of Blue</h3>
        <p>According to psychologists, blue can be a symbol of calming and peace. It is often associated with nature, particularly with the sea and water. It can also be a symbol of deep, yet quiet sorrow, as is implied by the expression "feeling blue". With that being said, blue is a much quieter color, and is often associated with deep and soft emotions, which can oscillate between calm, peaceful happiness and deep, quiet loneliness or sorrow.</p>
        <blockquote>This is why I find blue to be such an interesting color, and therefore, my favorite.</blockquote>

        <h4>Fun Facts about Blue!</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The color blue has a long and regal history, especially during the Renaissance where the use of deep blue for the Virgin Mary's clothing was made to symbolize her importance. Similarly, it was also used to denote your position in society, with blue being considered a high rank.</li>
            <li>Blue eyes are considered one of the rarest eyes for a human to have.</li>
            <li>Despite the sky being well-known as appearing blue, it is not actually blue; the blue light of the sky occurs from bouncing off dust and water particles that exist in the air. It is when this light is scattered in all directions that we see this blue sky.</li>
            <li>Blue is said to encourage productivity and creative problem solving.</li>
            <li>Blue has been scientifically proven to have a calming effect on the mind and body.</li>
