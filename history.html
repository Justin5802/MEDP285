    <h3>The Psychology of Blue</h3>

    <p>According to psychologists, blue can be a symbol of calming and peace. It is often associated with nature, particular with the sea and water.
      It can also be a symbol of deep, yet quiet sorrow, as is implied by the expression "feeling blue". With that being said, blue is a much more quieter
      color, and is often associated with deep and soft emotions, which can oscillate between calm, peaceful happiness and deep, quiet loneliness or sorrow.
