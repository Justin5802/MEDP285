        <p>Op art began from the intrigue and curiosity of artists wanting to build upon the nature of perception by producing optical effects using geometric shapes.
        These works of art were often considered unusual yet captivating, as it was intended to confuse and capture the eyes of many. Examples of artwork often used different color patterns, which would blur and confuse the viewer due to how these dimensions were perceived.

        <h3>The History of Op Art</h3>
        <p>While op art's origins are debated, most of these type of artworks truly became popularized around the mid-1960s. An abbreviation of "optical art", these works of art 
        were primarily made to emphasize abstract patterns, particularly between two different colors that often had a stark contrast. This, combined with one color making up the foreground and the other
        the background of a piece resulted in images that appeared confusing to the naked eye. Oftentimes, viewing op art would almost appear as if it was moving even though it was a still image. As a result, a lot of 
        op art was described as being an illusion, due to the contrast and appearance of conflicting colors giving the impression that the art was moving even though it wasn't.

        <h4>Fun Facts about Op Art!</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Op art popularized the term optical illusions, which is even more transparent about being works of art meant to confuse the naked eye</li>
            <li>The term "op art" was first named by Time Magazine in 1964, and was attributed to the artworks of French-Hungarian artist Victor Vasarely</li>
            <li>Op art has a lot to do with psychology since it was focused on the relationship between artists and their ability to create something that can trick a viewer's eyes, and therefore their brains</li>
            <li>Op art led to the creation of kinetic art. While op art only gave the impression that the art was moving, kinetic art consisted of works of art that actually moved</li>
            <li>Op art was described to be the connection between science and artistry, as it gave weight to the idea of using dimensions, psychology, and perception to create something that is mathematically and scientifically designed to trick people or make them perceive something that isn't actually there</li>
