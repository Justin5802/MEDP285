     <h2>What is this Website?</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is <a href = https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-chu-378989242 target = _blank>Justin</a>! I am a student at Hunter College with a strong interest in exploring the intersection between media and technology.
This website is a project for my web production class, and I made it about movies because it is something that I enjoy and am passionate about!</p>
