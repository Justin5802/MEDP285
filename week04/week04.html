                <h1>What are Movies?</h1>
                <p>Movies are a long-form medium of telling a story with the purpose of telling a story, to entertain, and to inform.
                This is a website made to explain what movies are, and some of my own personal favorite movies.</p>

                <h2>Why Should You Watch Movies?</h2>
               <p> You should watch movies because they can provide an escape from the real world. In addition, they can also be quite informative.
                They can entertain and excite you, but also inform you of different perspectives and ideas that you have never considered before. </p>
